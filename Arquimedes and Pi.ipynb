      "# Arquimedes and Pi\n",

      "Since high school I've been fascinated with $\\pi$ -- this infinite non-repeating irrational transcendent number. In fact, not only was I fascinated with $\\pi$ but I was fascinated about everything related to it. In 11th grade I asked my math teacher about how to deduce the area of a circle. Her answer: for that you need to learn how to integrate \u2013 wait until university. But I couldn't wait and head to the library where I found a single book that talked about the subject \u2013 an obscure calculus book by an author named [Piskunov]( https://archive.org/details/DifferentialAndIntegralCalculus_109). And, to integrate I've learned \u2013 just because of $\\pi$. But I digress. ..\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is not about calculus or \"symbolic\" integration. It's about how [Arquimedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) calculated $\\pi$ circa 200 B.C. In the \"Measurement of a Circle\" Arquimedes states that: \n",
      "\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \"The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is greater than $3\\tfrac{10}{71}$ but less than $3\\tfrac{1}{7}$\"\n",
      "> \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first really accurate estimation of $\\pi$. I.e., he calcuated $3.140845070422535 < \\pi < 3.142857142857143$. A good approximation of $\\pi$ is 3.141592653589793. So, this is two decimal places correct. That's pretty impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the story, Arquimedes did this by inscribing and circumscribing a circle with regular polygons and measuring their perimeter. As the number of sides increases, the better these polygons approximate a circle. In the end Arquimedes was using a 96-sided polygon. The next image illustrates the idea.\n",
